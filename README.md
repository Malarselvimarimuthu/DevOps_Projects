TASK 1:
Installing and Configuring Nginx using Jenkins
In this assignment, I used Jenkins to automate the installation and configuration of Nginx on an Ubuntu system. I created a Freestyle Project in Jenkins and added a shell script in the build step to:

Update package lists using sudo apt update.
Install Nginx using sudo apt install -y nginx.
Enable and start the Nginx service using sudo systemctl enable nginx and sudo systemctl start nginx.
Allow HTTP traffic (port 80) through the firewall using sudo ufw allow 80/tcp and sudo ufw reload.
Verify Nginx status using sudo systemctl status nginx --no-pager.
After successfully building the project in Jenkins, I accessed Nginxâ€™s default web page using http://127.0.0.1:80. Finally, I verified the installation using terminal commands and documented the process with screenshots.
